# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are commonly used to customize and personalize Linux- or Unix-based systems. This repository contains my personal dotfiles.

Here is a list of the programs I use. Programs for which I do not provide a dotfile are marked with a red X.

:white_check_mark: - alacritty: terminal emulator

:x: - nala: frontend for the APT package manager

:green_check_mark: starship: shell promt
