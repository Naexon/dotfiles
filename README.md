# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are commonly used to customize and personalize Linux- or Unix-based systems. This repository contains my personal dotfiles.

Here is a list of the programs I use. Programs for which I do not provide a dotfile are marked accordingly.

* __alacritty__ - terminal emulator
* __colorscript__ - :x: - terminal colorscripts collection by Derek Taylor aka DistroTube
* __fish__ - shell
* __nala__ - :x: -  frontend for the APT package manager
* __starship__ - shell promt
